Current build procedure needs heavy lifting.  Tmake does not even
error out when required packages are not found.  It just makes
assumuptions about where includes and libs are located, instead of
querying the system.

Current [2016-04-17]Â status on Debian/testing: BUILD FAILS.
(bison 3.0 compatibility issue)

My best guess for now:

git clone git@github.com:ydirson/serna-free.git
cd serna-free
git remote add debian git://git.debian.org/git/collab-maint/serna.git
git fetch debian
git checkout debian/wip/resurection debian/3rd/
mkdir -p 3rd/packages
ln debian/3rd/* 3rd/packages/
(cd 3rd && ./configure syspkgonly)
# WARNING! visually check for undetected dependencies !
(cd 3rd && ./checked_build.sh; )
(cd build && ./configure syspkg)
# WARNING! visually check for undetected dependencies !
(cd build && make)

# fails to build sfworks/xpath, parsers refer to "pargs"

 2 yacc parsers use deprecated feature that was removed in bison 3.0:

 sfworks/xpath/impl3/xpathParser.y
 sfworks/xslt/impl/xsltParser.y
