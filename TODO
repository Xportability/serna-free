* build

 * syspkg not compatible with debug ?

 * "No such file" right after build of spell plugin

 * look for "SVN ERROR"

 * cleanup obsolete? .pro files:
   find sfworks/ -name '*.pro' -not -name Makefile.pro


* runtime

 * spell plugin not really loaded, strace shows only wrong tries for
   libaspell


* examples

 * plugin examples not built
